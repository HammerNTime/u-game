### Create a Profile!
In your profile page feel free to update your Name, Profile Picture, Twitch Link, Bio, and consoles you own. You can even add a Gamer Tag for each console if you would like to connect with others online!

Don't forget to check out other people's profiles on the "All Profiles" page, so you can see what games they own and reviews they've made!<br>

### Don't let that mistake get you down!
Did you mess up your review? Or does the image you used for a game not look right? No Problem! Hit that nifty "Edit" button! Don't worry, only you can edit your reviews.
